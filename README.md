Android Nanodegree Project: 
Built an app, optimized for tablets, to help users to view a food recipe from an online database. It displays a scrolling list of recipes, launches a details screen whenever a particular recipe is selected, showing the ingredients list and steps. The tablet mode will show the video instruction side by side to the list of steps. It also allows user to place a widget on the home screen which shows the ingredients required without opening the app. 
This app utilizes core Android user interface components and SimpleExoPlayer to play the media.
